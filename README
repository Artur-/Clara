Clara - Declarative UI and bindings for Vaadin Framework
========================================================

Purpose of this project is to define a declarative XML-based syntax for defining Vaadin user interfaces. Also another goal is to provide support annotation-based binding of data sources and event handlers.

Project also serves as a part of my Master's thesis at the University of Turku and also derives from the work done by Joonas Lehtinen on his xmlui Vaadin add-on (http://vaadin.com/addon/xmlui).

Project Status
==============

The project is still very experimental and documentation is minimal at this point. Although you can still find a demo application demonstrating the current version of the project at:
