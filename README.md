## Clara - Declarative UI and Bindings for Vaadin Framework

Purpose of this project is to define a declarative XML-based syntax for defining Vaadin user interfaces. Also another goal is to provide support annotation-based binding of data sources and event handlers.

Project also serves as a part of my Master's thesis at the University of Turku and also derives from the work done by Joonas Lehtinen on his [xmlui Vaadin add-on](http://vaadin.com/addon/xmlui).

## Online Demo

The project is still very experimental and documentation is minimal at this point. If you still are interested to try things out you should see the [demo application](http://teemu.virtuallypreinstalled.com/clara) demonstrating the current version of the project.
